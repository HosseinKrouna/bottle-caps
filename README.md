# Bottle Cap Collection

Welcome to my **Bottle Cap Collection**! üçª This project allows you to manage and view a collection of bottle caps. The **overview page** displays all the caps in your collection, and each bottle cap has its own **detail page** with more information.

## Project Description

This project is a modern web application where each bottle cap is displayed as an item in a collection. The overview page shows all the collected bottle caps, while the detail page provides more information about each individual bottle cap. Users can navigate through the collection and learn more about each bottle cap.
